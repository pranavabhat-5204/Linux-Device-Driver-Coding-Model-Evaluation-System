**Linux Device Driver Coding Model Evaluation System**

So before you begin to run the evaluation file you will need to run:

!sudo apt-get update

!sudo apt-get install cppcheck

Otherwise you will get the cppcheck missing error.

Make sure that you use the standard C headers in your driver_from_model.c.
